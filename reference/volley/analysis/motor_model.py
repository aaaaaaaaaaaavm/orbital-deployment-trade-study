VOLLEY | Winding-resolved thrust constant, shot simulation, closed-loop dispersion.

This is the script behind the paper's headline performance numbers. It supersedes
the earlier lumped surface-current model (see legacy/c3_c4_em.py), which assumed an
effective airgap field of 0.62 T and produced 22.4 m/s. That model omitted the
one-half traveling-wave factor inherent to synchronous extraction; this one resolves
the three-phase belt winding directly against the verified field.

Reproduces (paper Secs. IV-B, V-A):
    thrust constant Kt          11.03 N per kA/m
    force ripple                +/-0.99 % (6th harmonic)
    exit velocity (3U)          16.39 m/s at 10.5 g
    pulse duration              159 ms
    bank SoC sag                5.3 %
    energy drawn                2.85 kJ
    payload KE                  537 J  -> 18.8 % gross electrical-to-payload
    copper heat                 835 J/shot
    closed-loop dispersion      0.027 m/s (3 sigma) at a 16.2 m/s setpoint

IMPORTANT: the sled field must TRANSLATE with the sled (np.roll on the field array).
An early version held the field fixed while commutating the current, which produced
a near-zero mean thrust. If Kt comes out ~0, check that first.

Provenance: model output, numerically cross-checked by A1; not experimentally validated.

Efficiency is electrical-to-payload. It used to be quoted with the note that the sled's
kinetic energy "is dissipated in the arrest brake by design and is NOT recovered". The
first half was right and the second half was never argued: the 2025 decision established
that the motor cannot ARREST the sled, not that none of its energy can be taken back.
A11 asked the second question and regen_brake() below answers it -- about a quarter of
the sled's energy returns to the bank inside the existing envelope, and the eddy brake is
still required for the rest. The original caution came from a real error (a 2021 draft
credited 55 % regeneration, giving 40 %, corrected to 32 %), and crediting nothing was the
safe response to it rather than the correct one.
