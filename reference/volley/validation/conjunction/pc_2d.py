"""A6: two-dimensional probability of collision, and whether it is a robust quantity.

WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
-----------------------
It is NOT the analysis `validation/A6_conjunction_cara.md` originally specified. That one
wants CCSDS OEM ephemerides out of GMAT and NASA's CARA tools driven by a covariance
derived from real Conjunction Data Messages. GMAT is not installed here, CARA is MATLAB,
and Space-Track is unreachable under this environment's network policy.

It IS the question P1 actually raised. P1 found that the 30-day minimum approach distance
swings from 4.6 to 63.4 km over a +/-2.5 % change in ejection velocity -- a near-resonant
beat sample, not a design property -- and the paper had quoted one draw from it as a safety
result. The obvious reply is that probability of collision integrates over the covariance
instead of sampling one geometry, so it should not swing like that. **Nobody had checked.**

Checking it needs a covariance, and no covariance exists for a satellite that has never
flown. So one is ASSUMED, stated in the output, and then the conclusion is stress-tested
against that assumption by sweeping it (band 5). A robustness result that survives halving
and doubling the assumed sigma does not depend on the number nobody has; one that does not
survive it is worthless and the sheet says so.

METHOD
------
Foster's 2-D P_c. At the moment of closest approach the encounter is treated as rectilinear
and the two covariances are combined and projected onto the plane normal to the relative
velocity. P_c is then the integral of a 2-D Gaussian over a disc of radius R = r1 + r2
centred at the miss vector:

    P_c = (1/(2*pi*sx*sz)) * integral over the disc of exp(-x^2/(2 sx^2) - z^2/(2 sz^2))

evaluated here by direct quadrature on a polar grid, which is exact enough at these
dimensions and needs no special functions.

Geometry comes from `analysis/astro.py::propagate()` -- the repository's own propagator --
so this cannot disagree with the rest of the project about where anything is.

Run:  python3 validation/conjunction/pc_2d.py
